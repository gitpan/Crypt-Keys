Revision history for Crypt::Keys

0.06  2002.02.16
    - First public release.
    - Added Filename argument to Crypt::Keys->detect.
    - Got rid of reliance upon File::Type; don't really need that much
      overhead, just a couple of regular expressions will do.
    - Added tests for Crypt::Keys->detect, for return value format
      and contents ('Format' and 'Description' of keyfiles).
    - Incorporated changes to Util::mp2bin and Util::bin2mp from
      Crypt::OpenPGP::Util.
    - Moved Crypt::DES3 code into Crypt::Keys::Private::RSA::SSH1, because
      that's the only place it is used.

0.05  2001.07.11
    - Documented data structure formats for Private key return
      values.
    - Standardized RSA-private return values. Private::RSA::SSH1 now
      calculates dp, dq, and iqmp on deserialize, and calculates u
      on serialize, in order to conform to the specification for
      RSA-private return values.

0.04  2001.07.10
    - Added test suite. Tests utilities (Util), buffer (Buffer),
      3DES inner-CBC encrypt/decrypt (DES3), all private key
      modules that are installed (Private), and all public key
      modules that are installed (Public).

0.03  2001.07.10
    - Added docs to Crypt::Keys.
    - Added bin/keydetect.
    - Added better error-handling through ErrorHandler.
    - Added Crypt::Keys::Buffer, which is a generalized
      buffer built on top of Data::Buffer that can handle
      any sort of SSH-style buffer.
    - Added public key formats.

0.01  2001.07.03
    - Initial version, based on sources from Net::SSH::Perl::Key
      classes.
