This is Crypt::Keys. It provides on-disk public and private key
management.

PREREQUISITES

The base prereqs are these:

    * Digest::MD5
    * Math::Pari (2.001804 or greater)
    * Data::Buffer
    * MIME::Base64

If you wish to read/write PEM-encoded files, you will also need

    * Convert::PEM (0.05 or greater)
    * Crypt::DES

And if you wish to work with SSH1 RSA files, you will need:

    * Crypt::CBC
    * Crypt::DES

INSTALLATION

Crypt::Keys installation is straightforward. If your cpan shell
is set up, you should just be able to do

    % perl -MCPAN -e 'install Crypt::Keys'

Answer the questions as to which encodings you prefer to use,
and you'll be on your way.

If you don't like that, you can download the distribution; the
latest version on CPAN can be found in

    ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/B/BT/BTROTT/

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install
